### 🫡 

Hey there! thanks for checking out my GitHub.

I’m a self-taught developer who got started during the pandemic back in 2020. At the time, I was working in collision repair, and coding felt like a way to control my future, especially as automation started creeping into the industry. “If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em,” right? What started as a hobby turned into a full-on obsession with building tech that moves things forward.

Around the age of 22, I realized I wanted more than just building software — I wanted to see humanity reach beyond the Earth. Credit goes to *Kerbal Space Program* for sparking that vision. Now, I’m building rockets. My long-term goal? To be the first person to launch a rocket to 100 km apogee solo. It’s ambitious, but I think it’s worth the shot. If nothing else, it’ll prove to myself (and maybe others) that a person can just get out there and make things happen.

### About My GitHub

Most of my work isn’t here; I’m constantly tinkering, experimenting, and figuring things out as I go. What’s here is a mix of projects and things I’m learning along the way.

### Reach Out

If you’re interested in helping me turn this journey into something sustainable — paying the bills while building the future — feel free to get in touch. Whether you’re working on something similar, have ideas, or just want to connect, I’m open to whatever might push things forward. Thanks for stopping by.
