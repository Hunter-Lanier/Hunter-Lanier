Hey there! thanks for checking out my GitHub.

I’m a self-taught developer who got started during the pandemic back in 2020. At the time, I was working in collision repair, and coding felt like a way to control my future, especially as automation started creeping into the industry. “If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em,” right? What started as a hobby turned into a full-on obsession with building tech that moves things forward.

Around the age of 22, I realized I wanted more than just building software — I wanted to see humanity reach beyond Earth. Credit goes to *Kerbal Space Program* for sparking that vision. Now, I’m building rockets. My long-term goal? I want to do my part to help humanity reach the stars and push human progress to other worlds.One day will have homes on the Moon, Mars, and others. We will need people build that future and thats what I want to do.

Most of my work isn’t here; I’m constantly tinkering, experimenting, and figuring things out as I go. What’s here is a mix of projects and things I’m learning along the way. Ive recently been working on hybrid rocket devleopment that I cant post about as much as I would like to

Thanks for visiting! feel free to reach out to me on X (@HunterALanier) because thats where me and my friends post most of our updates
